   <p> About us</p>
    <p>
    Over the past 50 years Centennial College has transformed itself from a local community college to a worldly institution with a presence in several emerging markets, including China, India, South Korea and Brazil.<br />

Our core focus, as it has always been, is on preparing graduates to enter the work force, while offering our students distinct ways to learn to be leaders. We’ve worked to build lasting partnerships with local communities
        <br /> while preparing our graduates to succeed in a global context.Locally we continue to offer industry-recognized full- and part-time programs at four Toronto campuses. Whether in our classrooms, our labs or the <br />
        community, students of Centennial experience the "real world" even before they graduate. They're job ready. And that's a fact employers have told us, as more than 94 percent of those hiring Centennial grads are <br />
        satisfied or very satisfied with their hires.As a leader in internationalization, we’ve done extensive work teaching international students. Conversely, we are enabling more Canadian learners to have an international <br />
         adventure: be it completing a semester in Spain, an internship in South Africa or a Global Citizenship learning experience in the Amazon Basin.<br />

We believe an education at Centennial is an education without borders, because the world has changed, and so have we. We’ve re-created our College, giving us a unique position in the marketplace and, in fact, the world.<br /> 
        And we are now prepared for the next set of challenges: to be more innovative and entrepreneurial; to further exploit the benefits of technology; to creatively engage our employees; to build more bridges with <br />
        communities and employers; to see our graduates do meaningful work and have meaningful lives.<br />
